	<h1><u>Population</u></h1>
	<p>In biology, a population is all the organisms of the same group or species who live in a particular geographical area and are capable of interbreeding.The area of a sexual population is the area where inter-breeding is possible between any pair within the area and more probable than cross-breeding with individuals from other areas.
<p>
	In sociology, population refers to a collection of humans. Demography is a social science which entails the statistical study of populations. Population, in simpler terms, is the number of people in a city or town, region, country or world; population is usually determined by a process called census (a process of collecting, analyzing, compiling and publishing data).
