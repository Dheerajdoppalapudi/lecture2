project description

In this project i have created 4 html pages based on the topic continents and population as a beginner i couldn't make an extraordinary website but i made a decent website.i have included all the attributes and tags which are taught in the leacture.In the first html page(name: project.html)i included some of the styling within the style tag i didn't link it with any of the css files.but, in the second html page(name:population)i have linked it with the css file and i have done all the related page styling in the css file(name:css1population.css)in these two pages i have included lists, tables, images and their related and suitable stylings to make them look good.i have also included id references and classes.In the project.html 
The color of the headings changes when the mouse is hovered or moved on to them
I also used the selection tag while selecting some information on the page. It gets highlighted in red and the text color changes to green.
If the size of the window changes the size of the text also changes.( mobile responsive (@media)querys)
If we click on any of the list items in the html page it directs us to the related text.
At the end of the first html page there is alink which directs us to the second html page.
This second html page(name:population.html) also got all the features mentioned above but all the related styling is done in the css file(filename:css1populatin.css).


Coming to the third html page(name:population.html)all the styling is done within the style tags i didnt link this page with other css files properties. I have included in this all the properties thai i mentioned above mobile responsive queries lists,tables,css selectors,classes,idâ€™s etc.
In the fourth html page i linked it with the sass file where i have done all the related styling of the html page in that file.In the sass file i have used SCSS variable,SCSS nesting, SCSS inheritance.I also have included all the features in this html file that are listed above.
